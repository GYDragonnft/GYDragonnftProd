# About the ProjectðŸŽˆ
This project consists in an open platform where each user can mint his own NFT and expose it on a marketplace by making an offer or buying NFT from others. It includes:

1. A smart contract which represents a collection of NFTs by following the ERC-721 standard
2. A smart contract which represents the NFT Marketplace and contains all the logic to make offers, fill offers...
3. Tests built with JavaScripts to ensure smart contracts are accomplishing the expected functionalities
4. A React.js front-end application as a user interface

# Project architectureðŸŽž

The user can access the application via web-browser, and he must have the Metamask wallet installed. This interface, built with React.js, relies on the web3.js library to communicate with the smart contracts through Metamask. This means that the data reflected on the front-end application is fetched from the Ethereum blockchain. Each action performed by the user (mint a NFT, offer NFT, buy NFT...) creates a transaction on Ethereum, which will require Metamask confirmation and pay a small fee, and this transaction will permanently modify the state of the NFTCollection and NFTMarketplace smart contracts.
